# ProbabilitySuite
Contains functions for performing a probabilistic selection from an array (probSelect.php), generating a random probability distribution on an array (probGen.php), and generating a uniform probability distribution on an array (uniformGen.php).

# ToDo
*	Optimise performance of the functions.
*	Fix bug arising from use of static variables in "probGen.php" and "uniformGen.php".
